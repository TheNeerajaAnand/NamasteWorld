## What is NamasteWorld
NamasteWorld is an online chat application made using ReactJs and socket.io

## Why we built it
Four newbies in the field of developing, Paavani, Purushoath, Ruthvik and me decided to submit our applications for Canada's biggest hackathon, HackTheNorth.
We worked on the invisible driving force of social pressure where we all published on our social platforms that we would be building for the hackathon.
This made us work harder to build a mini chat app.

## How can you get it into your system?

`git clone https://github.com/TheNeerajaAnand/NamasteWorld.git` 

Open the file using an editor and run the code `npm install @ant-design/icons axios react-chat-engine`
Make sure you have Nodejs v14.0 or higher installed in your system along with an environment for developing react

 `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The app is ready to be deployed!

## Future plans?
We are working towards finishing up the functionalities and based on it's popularity launch it in cloud since we can get more space to accomaodate more users and better reliability.
